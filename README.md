## Overview

<p> This portfolio will allow employers to look at my work. See some of my skills and get an understanding of whom I am as a developer. Employer will be presented with a photo of myself, links to my work, navbar that changes colors with a hover effect and previous projects. When the link is selected they will be brought to the corresponding section and when they click on an image they are taken to the project of choice. The page will also resize depending on various screens or devices. CSS is something that I continue to improve on and I am looking forward to improving my skill set. I am happy to have something that I worked on that provides a glimpse of my capabilities and personality. <p>
